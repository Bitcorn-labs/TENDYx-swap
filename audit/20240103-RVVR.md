## Executive Summary

### Engagement Overview

SNEED DAO engaged RIVVIR Tech LLC to review its SNS Dapp Canister.  From December 8th to 11th, 2023 Austin Fatheree reviewed the contract, made suggestions, investigated the contract and produced this report.  SNEED DAO responded to the audit and returned refactored and updated code based on the audit. SNEED DAO re-engaged RIVVIR Tech LLC to evaluate the responses and updates to the contract during the period of January 3rd to 7th, 2024.

### Project Scope

Our efforts were focused on identifying unneeded complexity, security issues, poor code quality, potential exploits, and other issues involved in the backend canister controlled by the SNEED DAO that is in charge of swapping OLD Sneed tokens for NEW Sneed tokens.

### Summary of Findings

Our follow up audit evaluated that the SNEED DAO team has adequately responded to all our concerns put forth in the initial audit.  In some cases we disagree with the conclusions that the SNEED DAO Team arrives at, but none of those issues affect the security or reliability of the smart contract to the extent that additional action must be taken.

## Project Goals

Our goals in this project is to make sure that the SNEED Swap canister does what it is intended to do. We want to:

- check motoko coding conventions and best practices
- address intercanister workflows
- identify exploits that would allow the capture of undue New or Old Sneed.
- identify potential cycle drain and DoS attacks.
- make sure upgrades work appropriately

## Project Targets

This Draft was performed against the commit 99d1b5f at https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp

We audited the backend motoko files.  An audit of the web application was not done.

## Code Maturity

| Category                               | Summary| Result           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Arithmetic                             | The code handles different token decimal representations and converts between them (from 12 to 8 decimals). It uses arbitrary precision Nats for calculations to avoid overflow issues and checks for underflows as well during token conversions. Careful handling of fee inclusion/exclusion in calculations also demonstrates due consideration of arithmetic concerns.| Strong           |
| Auditing and Logging                               | The contact includes logging functionality to track activity in update calls.| Strong         |
| Authentication / Access Controls       | The contract has some controls to ensure only authorized principals can call certain functions (`assert Principal.isController(caller)`). Functions that potentially modify the state (like token burns and settings updates) are restricted to controllers. There is no user-level authenticity check, but given the dApp's described usage nature, this seems to be by design and not an oversight. However, the lack of critical user-level access control could raise concerns in certain contexts, although it’s claimed not to be a risk by the documentation comments.| Moderate         |
| Complexity Management                 | The code's complexity is managed by splitting functionalities into well-defined private functions (e.g., `IndexOldBalance`, `IndexNewBalance`) and keeping the main logic in public functions clear. The separation of concerns suggests the developers have considered complexity management, which is reinforced by detailed comments.| Strong           |
| Cryptography and Key Management        | The contract doesn’t explicitly handle keys or cryptographic operations outside of the IC’s built-in Principal management since the dApp’s security seems to depend on the Internet Computer's model. There is no custom cryptography or key management, which is appropriate given the platform's capabilities.| Strong           |
| Data Handling                          | The code manages data handling through the use of Motoko's data structures like Maps and Arrays. It also uses stable variables to persist data across upgrades, with system functions for `preupgrade` and `postupgrade` managing data transformation when necessary. The use of types to enforce data structures and explicit error handling for potential data-related issues (like underflows) show attention to data handling. Some memory and compute heavy data structures like the base HashMap should be swapped out for more efficient structures like https://github.com/ZhenyaUsenko/motoko-hash-map             | Moderate           |
| Documentation                          | The smart contract is well documented through comments, explaining its purpose, workings, and specific functionality. It also includes a detailed LEGEND for variable naming conventions to clarify the handling of tokens with different decimals. Such extensive documentation is helpful for both developers and auditors to understand the code's logic and intent.| Strong           |
| Maintenance                            | The use of the `stable` keyword for critical variables indicates the contract is designed to be upgradable without data loss. The presence of `preupgrade` and `postupgrade` hooks likewise demonstrates foresight into the maintenance and lifecycle of the contract.| Strong         |
| Memory Safety and Error Handling       | The Motoko programming language provides memory safety by design, and the code makes use of pattern matching to precisely handle errors (`#Ok`, `#Err`), which provides rigorous error handling. There are also assertions and verifications for transactions, indexed balances, etc., to ensure a consistent state and error propagation in case of anomalies.| Strong           |
| Testing and Verification               | The code contains both unit and integration tests.  These tests cover many scenarios and demonstrate the functional completeness of the intended functionality.| Medium             |

### Title: Absence of try/catch handling for asynchronous canister awaits
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-4](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-absence-of-trycatch-handling-for-asynchronous-canister-awaits)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Try catch introduced in API surface methods, converting to Error. This scenario triggering cooldown is per design (and verified via test), to avoid excessive calls to an external canister that is trapping. Introducing specific try catch blocks around external calls was decided against, as their only role would be to rethrow the exception,
matching current behavior but with more code.

#### Response Evaluation:
The Unsuccessful Transfer and Unsuccessful Burn are not handled with a try catch. In both of these instances no state is changed before the call such that it is safe to not handle an error.  The state is actually kept in the remote ledgers.  Retrieval of data for Indexing also does not handle failure which causes no threat to state as the call must return before any state is updated.  Sneed has adequately handled the problem try/catch hot spots.

### Title: 100000 Results - Max Results Attack
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-5](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-100000-results---max-results-attack)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
The max_results parameter has been turned into a setting and any conversion seeking to convert an account with more than 100,000 transactions currently fails.  If this scenario is reached, the DAO may update the setting on a case by case basis

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Async Indexer Checking
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-6](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-async-indexer-checking)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Cooldown state is now saved to stable variable during upgrades. 

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Cycle Drain Attack via Intercanister Calls
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-8](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-cycle-drain-attack-via-intercanister-calls)

#### Status:
No Change.

#### Follow-up:
We see this as a general issue for the IC. We want to keep the application open (no logins). Implementing rate limiting for queries risks hurting legitimate users, so we would rather make sure the canister is monitored and well topped up (which would anyway be the case). Ultimately we believe this is an infrastructure concern that warrants general, rather than dApp-specific, solutions.  

#### Response Evaluation:
Sneed has chosen to not make significant changes to how this system operates.  It should be noted that the introduction of a one hour cool down on conversion and refunds makes this attack much harder to execute as the number of artificial accounts that would need to be created increase by a number of orders of magnitude.  Proper monitoring of the cycles and dedication to topping up the canister should suffice in keeping the canister operational even in the event of a cycle drain attack.  As this utility canister is generally a one direction and limited use canister to convert old SNEED to new SNEED it is unlikely that this issue will materially affect operations in the long term.

#### Final Severity:
Low

### Title: Inadequate Account Management Through Single-Account Risk
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-9](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-cycle-drain-attack-via-intercanister-calls)

#### Status:
No Change.

#### Follow-up:
This has been the subject of a lot of thought and discussion. That the application requires no login, and that users can send their funds to be converted from any wallet, have been seen as core requirements. This meant that much simpler solutions, such as the straight-forward (implementation wise, not necessarily for the user) Per-User Subaccount Single-transaction Swap, could not be used. It would still be possible to allow for a solution where users first ask the dApp to compute a subaccount for them, and then they send the old tokens to that subaccount of the dApp's principal. However, this would increase complexity in code and for users, and we have concluded that in the end it confers no substantial security advantage. 

Our reasoning is as follows. First, new token funds will always be comingled under the default subaccount of the dApp, so this only concerns the co-mingling of old tokens. It is our conclusion that allowing old tokens to be sent to custom subaccounts would not improve security, since the icrc1_balance_of method for the subaccount would not be the source of truth for how much a certain user should be able to convert, as two users could have sent old tokens to the same subaccount. Only the full inspection of all transactions to the account or subaccount (the current approach) can be the final arbitrer of convertible balance for a user, and adding subaccounts to the mix does not change the security of this approach. Thus, adding per-user dApp subaccounts would only serve to make burning old tokens a much more cumbersome operation, since they are now spread out over thousands of subaccounts. While it could potentially have been argued that using subaccounts would have been safer for the refund operation, we have removed the refund operation, as per advice in RVVR-SNEED-11, making this point moot.

Because adding subaccounts would increase dApp complexity (increasing the surface area for potential bugs), make burn operations cumbersome, and introduce an extra step for users, but still rely on the current approach of inspecting all transactions between the dApp and the account to be watertight (handle the case where two users send funds to the same subaccount), we have decided not to introduce per-user subaccounts to the solution. 

#### Response Evaluation:
Sneed has chosen to not make significant changes to how this system operates. It is certainly possible to secure and execute on co-mingled funds(The ORIGYN deposit system uses a single account pattern and has been operational for over 18 months.)  As mentioned by the team, the removal of refunds helps this situation as well.  The issues that remain will be informational and should not affect the security of the canister. 

#### Final Severity:
Informational

## Title: get_account, convert_account, refund_account - Text Input
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-10](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-get_account-convert_account-refund_account---text-input)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Changed to Account input parameter.

#### Response Evaluation:
Mostly Satisfied.  The Sneed team has opted for simplicity and not keeping an internal cache of ledgers and thus this call must remain an update call which could be used as a pathway for cycle drain. The conversion to Account input helps as the ValidateAccount function checks the size of the blob subaccount and principal before proceeding.

#### Final Severity:
Low

### Title: Unnecessary Complexity Due to Refunds Mechanism
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-11](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-unnecessary-complexity-due-to-refunds-mechanism)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Removed refund mechanism.

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Burned Block Pattern Optimization
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-12](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-unnecessary-complexity-due-to-refunds-mechanism)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
This would improve speed but not necessarily security. We have opted in favor of keeping minimal state and complexity in the app to optimize for robustness over speed. 

#### Response Evaluation:
The Sneed team has justified their desire to maintain state in other ledgers.  We still believe that relying on transaction log state would be simpler, but we do not find any issues with logic that the Sneed team has implemented and it appears to serve the functional requirements.

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Null Fee in TransferArgs Could Lead to Unhandled Fee Configuration Changes
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-13](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-null-fee-in-transferargs-could-lead-to-unhandled-fee-configuration-changes)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Fee is now included in transfer request.

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Memos added to transfer and burn operations. 

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Meaningful Error Codes
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-15](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-meaningful-error-codes)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Uses of GenericError replaced with specific errors.

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Error Conditions from Indexer Checks
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-16](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-error-conditions-from-indexer-checks)

#### Status:
No Change.

#### Follow-up:
We see no actionable distincion for the user if the last sent transaction is not seen because the indexer is lagging in tracking its first transaction (returning no transactions) or a subsequent transaction (returning some transactions but not the tracked one). In both cases the cause would be the same (indexer lag) and the action for the user would be the same (wait a while for the indexer to catch up).

#### Response Evaluation:
The Sneed team has chosen to not make a change.  We would note that the addition of logs will help in confusing instances where a user does not know why their transaction was failing if they are able to involve support staff that can check the log.  This does not affect the security of the contract.

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Lack of Logging Mechanism
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-17](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-lack-of-logging-mechanism)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Comprehensive logging added to all mutator methods.

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Improper Use of Integer Type for d12_to_d8 Conversion Variable
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-18](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-improper-use-of-integer-type-for-d12_to_d8-conversion-variable)

#### Status:
Implemented.

#### Follow-up:
Changed to Nat. NB: Int.abs( ) is still required to turn the result of a (Nat / Nat) operation from an Int to a Nat. Since both input terms to the division are (now) Nats, neither can be negative so it follows that the result of the division cannot be negative, thus this Int->Nat conversion is safe.

#### Response Evaluation:
Satisfied

#### Final Severity:
No Risk

### Title: Inadequate Set-Up of Smart Contract’s Canister ID
Finding ID: [RVVR-SNEED-19](https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/audit/20231211-RVVR.md#title-inadequate-set-up-of-smart-contracts-canister-id)

### Title: Missing Integration Tests for Sneed Converter dApp

#### Status:
No Change.

#### Follow-up:
We opt to sacrifice some speed to avoid including extra dependencies. 

#### Response Evaluation:
The Sneed team has chosen to stick with the inefficient hash map. Due to the transient utility nature of this contract we do not anticipate this map reaching a problem state or a state where the canister would run out of cycles in a round.  If the map did reach this state the team could mitigate it via an upgrade to the data structure. We do not anticipate this issue causing any issues other than a higher cycle usage.

#### Final Severity:
Low

# Evaluation of Added Tests

## Executive Summary

The team has added a number of tests that test the behavior of the contract during normal and expected operations.  While it is impossible to anticipate all possible scenarios, the team has done a thorough job of providing tests that cover the expected activation and operation of the contract.


## Converter.ActivationTests.mo

These tests adequately display the expected behavior of activating the converter.  They do not cover extraordinary scenarios where the canister has to be activated/deactivated, but we do not feel this is a threat to security as the canister will need to go thorough governance to perform these actions and an upgrade via the DAO can solve any problems that may arise around activation.

## Converter.BurnTests.mo

The tests seem to cover various scenarios related to the `burn_old_tokens` function, ensuring that the core functionality is tested thoroughly. Various cases such as a successful burn, non-controller call, cooldown handling, system traps, and settings restrictions are evaluated.

The following corner cases are not covered, but should not affect overall security and are provided as recommended suggestions only.

**Corner Cases Not Covered**:
   - There's no test for the happy path with a zero-amount burn. It would be beneficial to see how the contract handles a no-op burn.
   - No tests address potential precision-related issues when converting between different token decimal standards (8 versus 12).
   - There's no evident test for concurrent calls to the burn function and how the contract manages simultaneous state changes. (Confirming the cool down applies correctly)

## Converter.CanisterTests.mo

  The test cases cover a variety of scenarios, such as:
    - Checking the behavior of `get_canister_ids` on both inactive and active states of the dApp.
    - Validating the `set_canister_ids` logic for a controller and a non-controller.

  The tests that are provided seem to correctly test the contract logic for the tested functions. They check the return values against expected results, and well-designed checks for log items are in place to confirm that the contract performs as expected.

## Converter.ConversionTests.mo

The test cases cover a comprehensive range of scenarios including:
- Accounts with no transactions.
- Accounts with various combinations of old and new token transactions, including deposits to the dApp (`a2d`) and withdrawals from the dApp (`d2a`).
- The correct deduction of fees.
- Accounts that act as seeders or burners.
- Decimal conversions from old to new tokens (12 to 8 decimals).
- Error conditions such as stale indexers, external canister errors, cooldown logic, and invalid account handling.

The tests also include various checks on error types, error messages, and specific error properties, which demonstrates a thorough approach to assessing different aspects of error conditions.

The following corner cases are not covered, but should not affect overall security and are provided as recommended suggestions only.

**Corner Cases Not Covered**:
- Cases where there are large numbers of transactions that could realistically cause performance issues or exceed the bounds of the indexer's `max_results`.
- Tests for concurrency issues, such as initiating multiple conversions from different accounts simultaneously to ensure consistency.

## Converter.IndexingTests.mo

The tests cover various scenarios:
        - Accounts with no transactions returning zero balances
        - Accounts with only old or new token transactions
        - Accounts with old token a2d (account-to-dApp) and d2a (dApp-to-account) transactions
        - Accounts with new token a2d and d2a transactions
        - Accounts with both old and new token transactions
        - Accounts triggering underflows and marking as seeders/burners
        - Decimal conversion for tokens
        - Ensuring cooldown logic is respected
    - Many edge cases seem to be tested, including large transactions and different combinations of a2d and d2a transactions for old and new tokens. Accounts with mixed transaction histories are also considered.

The following corner cases are not covered, but should not affect overall security and are provided as recommended suggestions only.

**Corner Cases Not Covered**:

- Tests that specifically check for very small transactions to verify that the dApp handles rounding correctly on conversions, as decimal accuracy can be critical for financial transactions.
- A broader coverage of error handling would be beneficial, particularly in the interactions with external canisters where many things could go wrong (e.g., canister out of cycles, transient network issues, etc.).

## Converter.SettingsTests.mo

The `get_settings` and `set_settings` tests correctly assess whether the settings are retrieved and updated as expected. 

## Converter.SettingsTests.mo

- The tests cover a range of important functions such as indexing account transactions for old and new tokens, comparing accounts, checking cooldown logic, subaccount validation, and setting up canisters.
- The tests check for underflow conditions and ensure relevant flags are set (e.g., `is_burner` and `is_seeder`).
- Tests for transaction indexing include scenarios with zero transactions, transactions involving the dApp and account, large transaction amounts (that tag accounts as seeders or burners), and ignoring irrelevant transactions.

The inclusion of these tests helps significantly with security confidence.

# Evaluation of additional functionality

The Team did reorganize the project such that the actor class is now very easy to read and core logic was moved to a class. Other than these structural changes, logging, and a few minor changes to improve the security of the contract there were little to no additional functionality to review.
